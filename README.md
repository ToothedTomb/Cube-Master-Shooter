# Cube-Master-Shooter


In this game you got to kill as many enemies as possible in the game. The more you kill the more points you will gain. If you do die, then you lose all your points. The enemies are zombies, and they spawn randomly in the game. They will kill you. There are square cubes. There are +10 and -10. If you shoot +10 you gain 10 points. If you hit it, you will lose 5 points. If you shoot -10 then you lose 10 points also it only takes one bullet. If you run into it, then you will lose 12 points.  Do you have what it takes to gain more than 900 points? Play this game to find out...
